    <p>The Data Science &commat; LHC workshop was a resounding success. We do not plan to have traditional proceedings tied to individual talks, but we do want to capture the ideas that were generated during the workshop.</p>

    <p>With that in mind, we are soliciting contributions to the Journal of Brief Ideas. Each contribution is capped at 200 words, so this provides a lightweight method of collecting ideas that came up during the workshop. They do not have to be tied to a particular talk or speaker, and you can even submit several ideas with a different set of authors.</p>

    <p>The goal is to lay the groundwork for new collaborations and follow up studies, not to document completed research.</p>

    <p>All ideas will be stored in the <%= link_to "Data Science @ LHC collection of Brief Ideas", "http://beta.briefideas.org/collections/f85d3c54445e300bf6b6dd41a429d048" %> and given the tag <strong>DSLHC</strong>.</p>

    <p>Please <%= link_to "review previously submitted ideas", "http://beta.briefideas.org/collections/f85d3c54445e300bf6b6dd41a429d048" %> to get inspiration and to avoid duplication.</p>

    <p><strong>Some tips on a good submission:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>The title should be succinct and describe the outcome so that people can see at a glance what the progress in physics might be.</li>
        <li>The idea shouldn't be so technical that physicists in other fields are unable to read it.</li>
        <li>The idea doesnâ€™t need to have all the details worked out (this is a forecast of the unknowable future, after all) but it should concrete and as specific as possible.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p><strong>What to do now:</strong>
      <ol>
        <li>View the <%= link_to "previously submitted ideas", "http://beta.briefideas.org/collections/f85d3c54445e300bf6b6dd41a429d048" %></li>
        <li><strong><%= link_to "Submit your own idea", new_idea_path(:tags => "dslhc", :collection_id => "f85d3c54445e300bf6b6dd41a429d048") %></strong></li>
        <li>Comment on somebody else's idea with the next possible step</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>All ideas will be stored permanently and have a DOI assigned so that they can be cited just like regular papers and  can appear in your ORCID record.
